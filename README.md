# Rotating-platform-with-magnetic-displacement
This platform was designed to make 3D models of small corals inside a methacrylate tank with salt water (using photogrammetry).

The idea of ​​how this platform works is to control a stepper motor using an Arduino to rotate a cylindrical base inside a tank with salt water using a magnetic drive and control a Canon DSLR camera (in our case we use a 7D MKII) to photograph the object located on the base.

User can adjust, through a menu visible on a TFT screen, the number of photos in a 360º rotation, the possibility of autofocus before each shot, the waiting time between photos (so that the object to be photographed is completely still) and the time allocated to take each photo. All adjustments can be made using a rotary encoder.
